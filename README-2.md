# Overview

{This is my first ever program using Rust. The functions are not meant to be practical, but rather to demonstrate to myself how certain features work in Rust.}

{This program prints the classic Hello World statement, recieves the user's name and prints it back letter by letter using a for loop. It then prompts enters a loop, asking for an small integer from the user, then factorializes it. It will ask the user if they wish to enter another number, and breaks the loop when the user says something besides "yes". Finally, it tests the while loop feature by asking the user for yet another small integer, which it uses to calculate the Fibonacci number. Like the previous loop, the while loop ends when stops answering "yes".}

{Main objectives for this program: practice receiving, converting,and splicing user input. Write and call functions, including recursive ones. Set various kinds of loops.}

# Development Environment

{This was written primarily using Visual Studio Code, though initial setup of the folders was done using commands to Cargo in the terminal.}

{This project is written entirely in Rust. The rand library is the only library added so far.}

# Useful Websites

{The following resources were incredibly helpful in learning Rust, especially the Visual Studio Code instructions, which provided reliable explanations even when other sources were either vague, full of typos, or outdated.}

# Future Work

- Expand the fibonacci function. It shouldn't be this slow. Clearly my process is inefficient. 
- Add to the shuffle function to recapitalize the shuffled words.
